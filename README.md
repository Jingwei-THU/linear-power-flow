# A linear power flow model
## voltage magnitude & reactive power are considered
This code generates the Decoupled Linearized Power Flow (DLPF) and Fast DLPF (FDLPF) results in the paper:

Jingwei Yang, Ning Zhang, Chongqing Kang, Qing Xia,"A State-Independent Linear Power Flow Model with Accurate Estimation of Voltage Magnitude", published on IEEE Transactions on Power Systems.
